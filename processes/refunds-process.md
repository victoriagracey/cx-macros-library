# Refunds Process (System-Neutral)

A clear, consistent workflow for assessing and processing refunds safely, fairly, and in line with policy. This guide avoids platform-specific steps and focuses on universal principles that apply to any support environment.

## 🎯 1. Confirm the Reason for Refund

Start by clarifying the customer's situation to understand eligibility.

### Ask:
- What went wrong?  
- When did the issue start?  
- What were they expecting vs. what happened?  
- What charges or dates are they concerned about?

This ensures you fully understand the context before making decisions.

---

## 👤 2. Verify the Customer (Identity Check)

Before processing or discussing account-specific billing:

- Confirm email or account ID  
- Follow the company’s verification standard (security questions, last 4 digits of card, etc.)

This keeps customer data safe and compliant.

---

## 🧾 3. Check Billing History

Look for:
- The charge in question  
- The date, amount, and payment method  
- Any previous refunds or adjustments  
- Renewal dates  
- Free trials or promotional periods  
- Recent plan changes  

### Outcome:
Identify whether the charge is:
- valid under policy  
- duplicated  
- outside expectations  
- eligible for refund  
- not eligible, but goodwill possible  

---

## 📅 4. Review Refund Eligibility (Policy-Agnostic)

Generic eligibility guidelines:

### Eligible scenarios:
- Duplicate charges  
- Technical failures blocking access  
- Service paid for but not delivered  
- Incorrect or accidental billing due to system error  
- Recent renewals (case-by-case depending on policy)

### Not typically eligible:
- Charge is valid and plan was used  
- Renewal reminders were sent and visible  
- Customer changed mind after using service  
- Refund window has passed (if applicable)

### Always consider:
- Customer history  
- Fairness  
- Brand values  
- Long-term retention impact

## ⚙️ 5. Determine Refund Type

### 1. **Full Refund**
Used when:
- The service was not delivered  
- Major outage affected customer experience  
- Strong goodwill case  
- Duplicate or erroneous charge  

### 2. **Partial Refund**
Used when:
- Customer used part of the service  
- Mid-cycle cancellations  
- Compensation appropriate but not full amount  

### 3. **Store Credit / Account Credit**
Used when:
- Refund to original payment is not possible  
- Company prefers credit  
- Customer agrees to remain with service  

### 4. **No Refund**
Used when:
- Charge is valid  
- Outside refund window  
- Customer benefited from the service  
- Policy is clear and fair  

Be kind and human in the explanation.

### Goodwill Credit Option

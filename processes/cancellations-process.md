# Cancellations Process (System-Neutral)

A clear, consistent workflow for handling subscription or account cancellations. This guide focuses on verifying the customer’s request, checking eligibility, confirming final billing, and communicating next steps in a simple, predictable way.

---

## 🧩 1. Confirming the Request

Always begin by clearly confirming what the customer is asking for.

### Ask:
- Are they cancelling **immediately** or at the **end of the billing period**?
- Which subscription or product are they referring to?
- Do they understand any remaining access or charges?

### Template:
> To confirm, you’d like to cancel your **{plan_name}** subscription effective **{date}**, is that right?

---

## 👤 2. Verify the Customer (Identity Check)

Before modifying or cancelling an account, confirm identity using your company’s policy. Examples include:

- Email verification  
- Last four digits of payment method  
- Security question  
- Account ID  
- Last successful login date (system-dependent)  

### Notes:
Keep this section system-neutral — each company uses its own verification flow.

---

## 📅 3. Check Eligibility for Cancellation

### Things to review:
- Current plan  
- Renewal/billing date  
- Remaining access period  
- Trial or promo terms  
- Any outstanding invoices  
- Refund eligibility (if applicable)  

### Outcomes:
- **Eligible for end-of-term cancellation**  
- **Eligible for immediate cancellation**  
- **Refundable** (full/partial)  
- **Non-refundable**  

---

## 🧾 4. Clarify Billing Impact

Customers need to know exactly what happens next:

- Will they still have access until the end date?  
- Is there a final charge?  
- Is the current charge non-refundable?  
- Are they receiving a refund or prorated credit?  

### Template:
> Once cancelled, your access will continue until **{end_date}**, and you won’t be charged again.  
> There are **no further payments** due on your account.

OR

> Your plan ends today, and any unused time has been **{credited/refunded/not eligible for refund}** based on our billing policy.

---

## 🧵 5. Complete the Cancellation in the System

System actions vary, but generally include:

1. Open customer account in {billing system}  
2. Locate subscription under {subscriptions / plans / billing}  
3. Select **Cancel** or **End Subscription**  
4. Choose:
   - end of term  
   - immediate cancellation  
5. Add a cancellation reason  
6. Confirm the change  
7. Add internal notes summarising the request  

---

## 💬 6. Customer Confirmation Message

### Standard version:
> Your **{plan_name}** subscription has now been cancelled.  
> You’ll keep access until **{end_date}**, and you won’t be billed again.  
> If you change your mind, you can restart any time from your account settings.

### Immediate cancellation version:
> Your **{plan_name}** subscription has been cancelled effective today.  
> Your access has now ended, and your account won’t renew.  
> {Include refund/credit info if applicable.}

---

## 🎁 7. Save Attempt (Optional – Not Pushy)

Use this lightly and only where appropriate:

> If you're comfortable sharing, I’d love to understand what made you want to cancel — it helps us make things better.  
> No pressure at all.

---

## 📝 8. Internal Notes Template

> **Customer requested:** Cancellation of {plan_name}  
> **Effective date:** {today/end_of_term}  
> **Eligibility:** {eligible/not eligible}  
> **Refund:** {yes/no + amount}  
> **Reason given:** {customer reason}  
> **Notes:** All actions completed and confirmed with customer.

---

## 📌 9. Post-Cancellation Checks

After completing the process:

- Ensure subscription shows correct status  
- Confirm renewal is disabled  
- Check the next invoice date is removed  
- Make sure any credits or refunds applied correctly  
- Tag the conversation if needed (churn / feedback)

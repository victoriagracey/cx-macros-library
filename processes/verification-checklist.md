# Verification Checklist (System-Neutral)

A consistent, compliant process for verifying a customer’s identity before sharing or modifying account information. This checklist is system-agnostic and can be adapted to any company’s security policy.

## 🔐 1. Why Verification Matters

To protect customer data and prevent unauthorised access, verification is required before:
- Sharing account details  
- Discussing billing information  
- Changing settings  
- Cancelling subscriptions  
- Processing refunds  
- Accessing personal data  

Never skip verification, even if the customer seems familiar.

## 🧩 2. Approved Verification Methods (Choose Based on Company Policy)

Companies vary, but common verification methods include:

### ✔ Email Verification  
- Confirm they have access to the email on the account  
- Ask them to reply from the registered email  
- Or send a one-time token (system dependent)

### ✔ Security Questions  
- Date of birth  
- Full name on account  
- Address/postcode  
- Answer to chosen security question  

### ✔ Payment Method Checks  
- Last 4 digits of card on file  
- Recent transaction amount  
- Billing address  

### ✔ Account Details  
- Account ID  
- Username  
- Last login date (if platform tracks it)  

### ✔ Two-Factor / One-Time Codes  
- SMS or app-generated code  
- Email link or one-time password

## 🚫 3. Verification Methods You Should *Not* Use

Avoid asking for:
- Full card numbers  
- Full addresses written out loud  
- Passwords  
- CVV codes  
- Government IDs (unless company explicitly requires them)  
- Screenshots containing sensitive info  

These increase security risk and violate most data handling guidelines (GDPR, PCI, etc).

## 🪜 4. Standard Verification Flow (Universal)

### Step 1 — Ask for the minimum information required  
> To keep your account secure, I’ll just need to verify a couple of details.

### Step 2 — Request appropriate verification items  
Use **two pieces of information** when dealing with sensitive changes.

### Step 3 — Cross-check with the account  
Does the information match exactly?

### Step 4 — Proceed only when fully verified  
If any detail does *not* match, follow the “Failed Verification” flow.

## ❌ 5. Failed Verification Flow

If verification fails:

> For your security, I’m not able to make changes until we can confirm your identity.  
> Here’s what we can try next:  
> - reply from the email on the account  
> - provide last 4 digits of the card used  
> - answer a security question  
>
> I know this can be frustrating, but it’s important to protect your information.

Never disclose which part of verification failed.

## 🛑 6. Red Flags During Verification

Escalate if customer:
- Becomes pushy about bypassing verification  
- Tries multiple incorrect answers  
- Avoids verification entirely  
- Requests access to another person’s account  
- Shares suspicious-looking documents  
- Offers full card info or personal data unsolicited  

Document everything in internal notes.

---

## 💬 7. Verification Success Message

> Thanks! That matches our records — we’re all verified, so I can help with this request now. What would you like to change or check?

Professional, simple, safe.

---

## 📝 8. Internal Notes Template

> **Verification:** Passed/Failed  
> **Verified via:** {methods used}  
> **Customer requested:** {action they want}  
> **Notes:** No sensitive data stored or repeated.

Always note *how* you verified — never note the actual sensitive information.

---

## 🎯 9. Best Practices

- Use least-invasive verification first  
- Never repeat sensitive information back to the customer  
- Keep verification consistent across all agents  
- Limit visible data in your own tools (minimise exposure)  
- Follow the “two-factor” rule for high-risk actions  
- Document verification properly

- Be polite but firm — it’s non-negotiable  
- Explain *why* without overexplaining  
- Normalise the process ("we do this for everyone")  
- Avoid sounding suspicious  
- Stay calm if customer gets frustrated

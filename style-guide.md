# CX Style Guide (No-Bullshit Version)

## Core Principles

1. **Own the problem.**  
   No “sorry *if* you felt that way”. If we caused it, we say so.

2. **Be clear, not dramatic.**  
   Customers need to know what happened and what happens next. No fluff.

3. **Never blame the customer.**  
   Even if they made a mistake, we focus on fixing it, not rubbing it in.

4. **One promise, clearly stated.**  
   If we promise something, it must be realistic and easy to track.

## Tone Rules

- Short sentences > long paragraphs.
- No fake urgency. Only say “urgent” or “priority” when it truly is.
- Avoid corporate nonsense like “synergy”, “circle back”, “leverage”.
- Use plain, human language:
  - “We’ve messed up here” > “We apologise for any inconvenience caused”.
  - “Here’s what we’ll do next” > “We will endeavour to…”

## Useful Phrases

- **Owning the mistake**
  - “You’re right, this shouldn’t have happened.”
  - “We dropped the ball here, and I’m sorry.”
  - “Thank you for calling this out – you’re right to be frustrated.”

- **Setting expectations**
  - “I’ll get this checked and update you by **{timeframe}**.”
  - “This usually takes **{timeframe}**, but I’ll keep an eye on it.”
  - “If anything changes before then, I’ll let you know.”

- **De-escalation**
  - “I know you’ve already spent time on this, so I’ll keep this as quick as possible.”
  - “I don’t want you to have to repeat yourself, so let me summarise what I’ve understood.”

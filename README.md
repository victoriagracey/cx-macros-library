A lightweight, internal-style CX documentation system built with GitHub Pages that dynamically indexes Markdown content via the GitHub Contents API.

---

## Overview

Customer support teams rely on fast, consistent access to macros and process documentation. This library is built from real-world customer support experience and focuses on clarity, empathy, and operational consistency in high-volume environments.

The goal is not to sound scripted or robotic, but to enable faster, safer responses while maintaining a human tone across channels.

## How to Use

1. Find a macro close to the situation.
2. Swap in the placeholders (like `{customer_name}`, `{order_id}`, `{timeframe}`).
3. Adjust wording slightly so it fits the brand voice.
4. Save new variations back into the library if they work well.

**Example**

Original:
- “Your refund has been processed.”

Macro-style:
- “I’ve gone ahead and processed your refund — you should see it back with your bank within `{timeframe}`. If anything looks off, reply here and I’ll check it for you.”

This repo is a work in progress. Expect messy drafts and constant tweaks.

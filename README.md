# CX Macros & Phrases Library

A small collection of reusable customer support macros and phrases.

The goals of this library are:

- To reply faster without sounding like a robot
- To keep tone consistent and respectful under pressure
- To make it easy to adapt replies for different channels (email, chat, social)

---

## Structure

- `style-guide.md` – core tone and principles
- `macros/general.md` – general acknowledgements, thanks, and check-ins
- `macros/refunds-and-compensation.md` – refunds, partial credits, goodwill gestures
- `macros/delays-and-outages.md` – delivery delays, system downtime, long queues
- `macros/technical-issues.md` – troubleshooting & bug acknowledgements
- `macros/membership-and-billing.md` – subscription, billing, account access

---

## How to Use

1. Find a macro close to the situation.
2. Swap in the placeholders (like `{customer_name}`, `{order_id}`, `{timeframe}`).
3. Adjust wording slightly so it fits the brand voice.
4. Save new variations back into the library if they work well.

This repo is a work in progress. Expect messy drafts and constant tweaks.

# Accessibility-Friendly Macros

These macros aim to support customers who may benefit from clearer language, simplified instructions, or alternative communication formats. They avoid jargon, reduce cognitive load, and ensure our responses are inclusive and easy to understand.

## ♿ 1. Plain Language – Simplified Explanation

> Hi {customer_name},  
> I know this can be confusing, so here’s a simple explanation:
>
> **{feature/process} means:** {clear, short explanation in everyday language}.  
>
> If anything still doesn’t make sense, just let me know and I’ll break it down another way.

---

## 📘 2. Step-by-Step Instructions (Clear & Numbered)

> 1. Open **{app/website}**  
> 2. Tap **{menu or button}**

>
> Take your time — if you get stuck at any point, just tell me which step you’re on and I’ll guide you through it.

## 🔊 3. Offering Alternative Formats

> If it helps, I can explain this in:
> - shorter steps

## 💬 4. For Customers With Cognitive Load Challenges

> I know this might feel overwhelming, so let’s take it one piece at a time.

## 👁️‍🗨️ 5. Visual Impairment–Friendly Language

> Thanks for your message.  
> I’ll describe things clearly so you don’t need to rely on visuals:
>
> - The button you need is labelled **{button_name}**  
> - It’s usually found near the **{top/bottom/right/left}** of the screen  
> - When you tap it, you’ll hear/feel {expected behaviour}  
>
> If you prefer, I can also give you step-by-step spoken-style instructions.

## 🔄 6. Reassuring When Customer Says They Don’t Understand

> No worries at all — you don’t need to apologise.  
> Let’s try a different way of explaining this.  
>
> Here’s the simple version:  
> **{one-sentence clarity statement}**
>
> Does that make more sense? If not, I’ll try another approach.

## 🧠 7. ADHD-Friendly Instructions (Short + Direct)

> Totally get it — here’s the quick version:
>
> **Do this:** {step 1}  
> **Then this:** {step 2}

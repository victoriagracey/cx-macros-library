# General Macros

## 1. First Response – Acknowledging the Issue

**Use when:** Customer reports an issue for the first time.

> Hi {customer_name},
>
> Thanks for getting in touch and explaining what’s been happening.
>
> I’m sorry you’ve had to deal with this – it’s not the experience we want you to have. I’ve taken a look at your account and I’m currently checking what’s gone wrong so we can sort it.
>
> I’ll update you by {timeframe} with either a fix or a clear next step.
>
> {agent_name}

---

## 2. Quick Thank You & Confirmation

**Use when:** Customer has sent extra info, screenshots, or done something you asked.

> Hi {customer_name},
>
> Thanks for sending that over so quickly – that’s really helpful.
>
> I’ve added this to your case and I’m continuing to look into it. I’ll come back to you by {timeframe} with an update.
>
> {agent_name}

---

## 3. “We’re Still On It” (Avoiding Silence)

**Use when:** You don’t have a full answer yet, but you refuse to go silent.

> Hi {customer_name},
>
> I just wanted to let you know I’m still working on this for you.
>
> I’m waiting on more information from {team/partner}, and I’ve asked them to prioritise your case. I’ll check back on this by {timeframe} and update you, even if it’s just to confirm we’re still on track.
>
> Thanks again for your patience,
>
> {agent_name}

---

## 4. Closing a Resolved Case (Polite but Final)

**Use when:** Issue is fixed and you want to close the loop without sounding cold.

> Hi {customer_name},
>
> Just a quick note to confirm this should now be sorted.
>
> I’ve {brief description of fix}, and I’ve double-checked on my side that everything looks correct.
>
> If anything doesn’t look right, or if something similar crops up again, reply to this message and it’ll come back to me or one of the team to review.
>
> Thanks for bearing with us while we fixed this,
>
> {agent_name}

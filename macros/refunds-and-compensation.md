# Refunds & Compensation Macros

## 1. Confirming a Refund Has Been Issued

> Hi {customer_name},
>
> I’ve processed your refund for **{amount}** back to your **{payment_method}**.  
> You’ll see it on your statement within **{timeframe}** (this depends on your bank).
>
> Thanks for your patience while we sorted this,
>
> {agent_name}

## 2. Partial Refund / Goodwill Credit

> Hi {customer_name},
>
> You’re right — this wasn’t up to our usual standard.  
> I’ve added a **{amount}** goodwill credit to your account to make up for the trouble.
>
> It’s available immediately and will automatically apply to your next **{order/billing cycle}**.
>
> If anything else feels off, let me know — I’m here to help.
>
> {agent_name}

## 3. Refund Denied (But Staying Human About It)

**Use carefully. Tone matters.**

> Hi {customer_name},
>
> I’ve checked this fully, and I’m afraid we’re not able to offer a refund for **{reason}**.  
> I know that’s not the answer you were hoping for, so I want to explain clearly:
>
> **{Short explanation of policy or event, in plain English}**
>
> If anything changes on our side or more information comes through, I’ll update you right away.
>
> {agent_name}

## 4. Compensation When the Issue Was Our Fault

> Hi {customer_name},
>
> We didn’t get this right, and you’ve been more patient than we could reasonably expect.
>
> I’ve added **{amount}** to your account as an apology for the inconvenience.  
> You don’t need to do anything — it’s already active.
>
> Thanks for giving us the chance to fix this,
>
> {agent_name}

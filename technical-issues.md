> I can see why this would be frustrating — let me look into it for you.  
> Before I run a few checks, can you confirm:
> - the device you’re using  
> - the app/browser + version  
> - a screenshot if possible  
>
> Once I have that, I’ll be able to pinpoint what’s causing this and get it sorted.
